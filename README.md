**Manage GitLab Runners in Docker via REST**

</div>

If you're running GitLab runners in Docker and you're looking for a simple, non-manual way of doing
so, runrs has you covered. You can run runrs in your Docker alongside the GitLab Runners control
service - it just needs access to the configuration file containing Runner configs and things will
_just work‚Ñ¢_.


## Motivation

Running GitLab Runners in Docker is simple, but managing them - adding new ones, cleaning up,
rotating them - is an annoying manual task. If you're anything like us, you don't like those.
Moreover, it's something we don't do _that often_ - a few times per month perhaps - so we end up
looking up the manual steps in the GitLab docs every godforsaken time. Meanwhile, pretty much
everything else we run is Terraformed, which makes this doubl-y annoying.

Thus, we wrote this simple service which provides a CRUD API for GitLab Runner configurations and
can run in Docker, managing the Runners configuration file. We also have [a Terraform provider]()
you can use to _GitLab Runner Setup as Code_ your Runners.


## Using runrs in prod

We don't recommend you do (just yet).


## Local Development Setup

It's a vanilla Rust and `cargo` project, so if you have a recent (1.75+) Rust toolchain installed,
you should be good. For testing end to end, you'll need:

- Docker, which is going to be used as the executor for your runners, up and running, and
- `gitlab-runner`, either installed and running locally or running in Docker. The docs for
  installing it are [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/osx.html).

Configuration is done via the `.env` file in the repo. We know that that's bad, and we intend to fix
that, but remember we also told you we don't recommend running this in prod yet, so yeah.

### Setup

1. Clone the thing.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bmc-labs/runrs.git
   cd runrs
   ```
1. Build and run the thing.
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

Similarly, testing is via `cargo test`, as you might have expected.

That's it. Make a PR with your changes and we'll talk about them.


## Support

This is an open source project, so there isn't support per se. If you open an issue in the
repository, we'll try and help you, but no promises.
